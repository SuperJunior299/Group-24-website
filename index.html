				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">Ton Duc Thang University was my alma mater when I was a sophomore. Computer Science was my prior major, and it is a well-known major in the IT field. During my time at Ton Duc Thang University, I got the opportunity to study in the Czech Republic for seven months at VSB Technical University in the Ostrava district. Nonetheless, because of the Covid-19 epidemic, I was obliged to return to my country and terminate my studies in the Czech Republic. Now, I'm a freshman at RMIT University, majoring in information technology. To be honest, I spend much of my leisure time playing badminton and watching movies or technology events.</p>

Furthermore, sports are an important part of my life, and I often decide to swim after a hard day at the computer since it provides me a cool and refreshing vibe. I quite like machine learning and artificial intelligence. it may be the trend in the future. In addition, while studying online, I also researched and learned more about web programming. I am curious and interested when I can create my own blog in the future. About my experience in IT I can write a website and create useful tools in Python.</p>

				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">The reason why I came to It is that when I was 15 years old, I read an article about information technology, which mentioned server computers. I was fascinated by the number of calculations that this machine did in one second - 10 trillion calculations per second. Since I read that article, I started to explore the world of IT. I have tried to find out the mechanisms of computers and robots for 3 years in High school. I got inspiration from my brother, who also studies Information Technology in the University of Science and Technology in Danang. One day, he showed me how he developed a snake game in 1 hour, which inspired me a lot in program development. When I was in grade 12, I started to learn how to code. It's quite late for me to learn coding at the age of 17, but this is the first time that I find interest in programming. I studied on Codecademy, which is my favorite website about teaching coding and the teaching method is suitable for new student. When I got into RMIT University, I learned much more about the art of code and much knowledge about information technology. The reason why I chose RMIT as my university is that RMIT has a team of lecturers, who have many experiences in the field of information technology. Moreover, the study environment in RMIT is much better than other universities, the facility here is fully equipped with modern devices, which support me a lot in my study. I hope that during my study in RMIT, I will learn much more about the world of IT and coding. Also, I think that learning in RMIT can help me to create new relationships and learn soft skills such as communication or teamwork. </p>

			<div class="section-teamProfile-mainHeading">
				<h1 class="section-teamProfile-heading">II / Project Idea</h1>
				<h2 class="section-teamProfile-teamname">Detailed Description</h2>
			</div>

			<!-- Loi -->
			<div class="section-teamProfile-information">
				<h3 class="section-teamProfile-ultraSubHeading">1. Aim</h3>
				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">We have set up a website for selling motorbikes, which serves the need of selling motorbikes, especially large displacement motorcycles.

The reason why we choose large displacement motorcycles as our selling products is that most Vietnamese use motorcycles as their daily transportation, which is up to 79% of total population, while it is just 10% globally. For this reason, the motorcycle business is very prosperous in Vietnam. Our website provides many quality motorcycles. Moreover, our website specializes in selling large displacement motorcycles, which are up to 1000cc, mostly from Suzuki, which is one of the famous Japanese motorbikeâ€™s manufacturers. Some of the models are available in our shop: Gixxer SF250, Satria F150â€¦

First of all, we need to build the backend of the web, build some features such as login or search for motorcycle models. Building backend is very demanding for web development, they have to make sure that the web is running without any bugs or slow processing. 
Second, the front end of the web should be taken into consideration. The UI of the web should have many functions which satisfy the needs of customers such as Chat Bot or AR. Moreover, the design of the web cannot be ignored, so we have to choose appropriate colors for the background and words, so that our website will be attractive to customers.
</p>
			</div>
			<!-- PLAN AND PROGRESS -->
			<div class="section-teamProfile-information">
				<h3 class="section-teamProfile-ultraSubHeading">2. Plan and Progress</h3>
				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">In our fast-paced world, web application development is growing increasingly popular and organizations are short of human resources for professions or roles like Front-End, Back-End, and Full-Stack. That was also one of the driving forces behind my decision to begin studying about the notion of website building and current industry demands. <br>
					Web design and development has been around for almost as long as websites themselves. It used to have a lot more straightforward meaning since creating a website was formerly a much easier task. However, due to the cutting-edge technologiesâ€™ appearance, the web developers need to embed the sophisticated techniques to these applications. <br>
					The term "web design and development" refers to the process of developing a website. It entails two key skill sets, as the name implies: web design and web development. A website's look and feel are determined by web design, while its functionality is determined by web development. Front-end development is the process of implementing a design using coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can interact with buttons, photos, text, contact forms, and navigation menus using these languages. They're also important for responsive and adaptive design. <br>
					What was the motivation behind the creation of the Suzuki motorcycles website? I like studying about motorcycles, and Suzuki is one of my favorite motorbike manufacturers. Initially, I just intended to do solo coding; but, I believe that in order to produce a professional website, I will need to locate a colleague with whom I can collaborate to create a product and even a website, and with whom I can work for a long time in the future. That will help us in our future employment choices. <br> 
					That is exactly what occurred when I started studying at RMIT University, where I met four teammates: Quang, Ky Anh, and The Anh. We get along swimmingly and always respect one other's viewpoints. Fortunately, the group's accommodation is not far from where I live, so we can easily collaborate directly. We spent the first week getting to know each other and learning about each other's personalities in order to evaluate whether we were a good fit to collaborate and build the product together. <br> 
					<b style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Aim:</b> The aim of the website is to increase the experience for customers when visiting our website. In order to achieve this, I have divided it into 2 sub aims. The first aim is to make the website look simple, friendly to users but meet the standard of harmony in both color scheme and logo design. For the second aim, the customer will be provided support from our Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality, The Artificial Intelligence play as consultant and customer care, which answers all questions of customer about websiteâ€™s services as well as products. Our Argument Reality display samples and specifications of the motorcycles with an overview and specifics. <br>
					<b style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Updates and changes: </b>Updates and changes: As a scriptwriter of the website, I have to summarize ideas of all team members to write content for the website. At first, everyone agreed that the website should contain as much information as possible, which means that the website should display all of the information about the product. However, after I read an article about how to build a smart website (https://cuttingedgepr.com/fewer-words-web-page-smarter/), I presented to the group and everyone was agreeing that our website should contain main ideas of the product, which doesnâ€™t cause anxiety for customer when visiting our website. For this reason, I started to write content in a brief but complete way. By writing this way, customers can firmly grasp the content instead of reading the whole text without understanding the content. Moreover, succinctly writing can make customers make a right choice when they buy the product at our shop. <br>
					<b style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">How it has progressed: </b>As we agreed on developing an online motorcycle web store, the first thing to do was to build the website itself using three main languages including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So far, we have completed building the landing page of the website, which includes the featured product along with its basic information, section links to other pages of the website, a search bar and basic social media contacts. At first, the website could only be accessed offline by downloading its components and launching it locally on a computer, but currently, the website is now able to be accessed online by anyone with a link to it. The animation of the login form when users click on the login button was implemented by the JavaScript's script tag embedding in the file HTMLâ€¦
As mentioned in the presentation, the web will also implement the use of augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI chatbot). The AR technology will be used to create virtual models of products, which are motorcycles and/or parts. Currently, the team has decided that the AR will be used for previewing products in real life, effectively helping customers with the information of products. Meanwhile, the AI chatbot will be used as a guide for customers visiting the website, effectively helping them navigate the store and choose products. So far, we are planning to have the AI ask users a series of questions about their preferences, then based on the answers, recommend them with products that best fit said preferences.

			</div>
			<!-- SCOPE AND LIMITS -->
			<div class="section-teamProfile-information">
				<h3 class="section-teamProfile-ultraSubHeading">d. Scope and limits</h3>
				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">We should be conscious that before bringing the product to market, we must first establish the project's scope and limitations. The execution of the project scope statement is a crucial section of product development. So, what exactly is the Project Scope Statement?
The project scope statement provides a detailed explanation of the project's final outcome. Project objectives, deliverables, milestones, project requirements, technical specifications, and restrictions and exclusions are often included. A poorly specified scope will undoubtedly be a stumbling block to project success. According to research, 50 percent of project planning difficulties may be traced back to a lack of clarity in the scope and goals of the project. Under the supervision of the project manager and the client, the scope should be created. <br>
In terms of project objectives, we will identify the project's overall goals in order to satisfy the needs of your users. The questions of what, when, and how much are answered by objectives. The project is designed to create a motorcycle web using a combination of audio, video, and advanced AI and AR technologies. Teenagers and adults between the ages of 13 and 40 would be the target demographic for this initiative. To clothe and wow users, a suitable and engaging text, image, video, and animation of AI and AR would be embedded on the web. The proposed prototype's programming would be difficult due to a lack of expertise about AI and AR technology. As a result, the final product would be a prototype with no optimization features. Due to the limited time frame and limited understanding of both advanced technologies and others, the AI and AR implications on this suggested site would not be able to be implemented as the professional environment of other firms. The prototype, on the other hand, would improve the users' knowledge and abilities in technology trends.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- TOOL AND TECHNOLOGIES -->
			<div class="section-teamProfile-information">
				<h3 class="section-teamProfile-ultraSubHeading">e. Tool and Technologies</h3>
				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">First to create a website we need code editor software. We choose Visual Studio Code Community. This is a free version and has support for many extensions like: live server, GitHub, docker, these will support our team for web development. Not only that, this is a software with a large community, so the ability to support problem solving is very reliable. the second is GitHub, one of the powerful tools that helps us bring everyone on the team together. We decided to use pro session because it will help us a lot in website development. features such as web-based, large storage capacity, in-depth project management are essential for our project. According to my team's experience, both of the above software has an easy to use interface and we have received a lot of support from their community so we are very confident using both to do this project. In addition to software, hardware is also very important to our project. To develop the AI chat bot feature and especially the augmented reality motorbike viewing feature, we need a computer system with a powerful CPU and GPU, such as the i7-th10 and RTX 4000. We need mobile devices with at least 2 cameras to facilitate the development of AR technology. <br>
					We use basic tools for debugging and testing like: Selenium which is used for website functionality testing and database testing, or Ranorex for UI testing, next we will use the JMeter tool, which allows us to see the performance of the website and find solutions to improve the user experience. All this testing software have been recommended by experts, so it is very reliable. Also, these are tools that early web developers know.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- TESTING -->
			<div class="section-teamProfile-information">
				<h3 class="section-teamProfile-ultraSubHeading">f. Testing</h3>
				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">Testing will be done step by step. Following are the must-dos for testing jobs: Functionality Testing of a Website, Usability testing, Interface Testing, Compatibility testing, Performance Testing, Security testing. We will break down the testing work into parts. Creating checklists and test cases will help us not to miss any bugs. To ensure that the project is on schedule, testing will take place throughout the development process. Which means we will test and test after certain features have been completed. For us the success of a website is a website that achieves its original goal, which consists of a simple, easy-to-use interface and outstanding features. The criteria set out by the team must work well such as: accessibility, simple interface, all functions working well, stability of the website, images displayed in high quality, security and enhance the customer experience. We will publicly open a simulation website for customers to experience and collect customer feedback on our products from which to consider whether it is suitable for the original goal. If appropriate, we will absorb and correct the shortcomings. We need a user base to test the features and experience of the site and expect more than 1000 site visitors. We will launch advertisements about the website through motorcycle groups on social networks. The last part is the feedback from users after the experience is complete. A small reward will be given to the lucky person who completes the feedback section to attract more participants.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- RISKS -->
			<div class="section-teamProfile-information">
				<h3 class="section-teamProfile-ultraSubHeading">h. Risks</h3>
				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">For our project aim which is to develop an online web store for the purpose of advertising and selling motorcycles, there are certain risks to be aware of as we proceed with the project.
First of all, as our website acts as an online store, it requires the need for the implementation of user accounts in order for customers to interact with the store, including ordering items, saving items to a Wishlist, favoriting items, applying for promotions and vouchersâ€¦ As we implement user accounts into our website, there is a risk regarding the potential lack of security for these user accounts, mainly as a result of us being novices to the IT world, possibly harming current and potential customers. <br>
Next, we can also mention the risk of the inconsistency of information among members in maintaining and managing the information provided by the website. Although the website is essentially a motorcycle store, a few members of us are not well-educated enough in regards to motorcycles and automobiles in general. As a result, data inconsistency regarding the products provided by the website may occur, as certain members do not possess enough expertise in the area. This may lead to confusion for customers and viewers who visit the website, negatively affecting the project.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATIONS -->
			<div class="section-teamProfile-information">
				<h3 class="section-teamProfile-ultraSubHeading">i. Group processes and communications</h3>
				<p class="section-teamProfile-content">Communication with team members is very important. The success of a project cannot be completed by one person. There will be many problems and many changes will occur throughout the project. Therefore, the discussion in the group is very important not only for appointments and we also exchange code with each other through GitHub. Usually, we have online meetings to discuss the difficulties that members face and then find a solution. The frequency of the online meetings will be every Wednesday night, because we think this is the right time of the week to sum up the issues encountered. In addition to the online meetings, we also organize face-to-face meetings at the end of each week, a time to summarize and discuss the progress of the work. We also have a Messenger chat group to discuss more about small issues. We always encourage and motivate each other in communication. If a team member ignores a message or meeting, the team leader will be the one to find out the reason and then give advice to the team member to return to work soon. If the matter continues and there is no good argument. We will either remove the member or replace the member with a new member. We are very concerned with the reputation and progress of the work, so the members participating in the project must comply with the group's regulations.
